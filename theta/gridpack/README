The "build.sh" script creates the file "gridpack.tgz" which contains all binary files
required to run theta in a minimal environment which does not have ROOT
or other dependencies installed. This can be useful to run theta on a cluster or on the
grid, hence the name "gridpack".

Before running "build.sh", make sure you have set up all dependencies correctly (i.e.,
theta runs for your configuration), including setting the $ROOTSYS environment variable,
if you use the root plugin.

If you unpack "gridpack.tgz", you have four directories:
bin --- containing the main theta executable, "theta" (which is actually a script to do some setup)
lib -- containing theta plugins and theta-internal dependencies
extlib -- containing external shared dependencies (root, sqlite, boost, ...)
etc -- some special files for ROOT

Note that you have to care care of any additional dependencies like
your own configuration files and maybe root input files required by these.
Typically, one would create a single archive (say grid-runtime.tgz) containing 
1. the configuration file (say, theta.cfg). Make sure that any paths in theta.cfg
   (to plugins and templates.root) are relative so they can be resolved on the worker node
2. required histogram input for 1. (say, templates.root)
3. gridpack.tgz

The script to be executed on the worker node could then be something as simple as
# copy gridpack.tgz from known location to here (if not already in the sandbox)
tar xzf gridpack.tgz
bin/theta theta.cfg
# copy theta output to some se

In general, it is advisable to test your grid runtime with minimal environment variable settings
(empty LD_LIBRARY_PATH and empty ROOTSYS) before submitting it.
