The subdirectories within this directory contain some realistic
examples for the usage of theta-auto.

ks_test:
For the validation of the modeling in a sideband, one can compatibility tests between data and MC.
However, if these distributions are affected by rate and shape uncertainties, one should
include them in the comparison by performing toy experiments, making a fit and only then calculating a chi2 value or a KS value.
How such a KS-test including shape uncertainties can be performed with theta-auto is shown here.

execute "../../theta-auto.py" from this directory to see a list of p-values for each distribution.
In each case 5000 toys are performed.



zprime:
This is a search for Zprime -> ttbar and is a complete example of a more complex analysis
which 
 * uses more than just one channel
 * uses template morphing to model shpae uncertainties
 * has several independent signal hypotheses, the Zprimes at different masses
The theta-auto script makes limit band plot for expected and observed limits
for Bayesian and CLs limits.

In the end, a chi2 test using the background-only model is performed.
