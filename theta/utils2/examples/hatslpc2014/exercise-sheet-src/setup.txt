Technical Setup
***************

The exercises make use of python and the `scipy library <http://scipy.org/>`_ and the `theta <http://theta-framework.org/>`_ program.

To make the theta installation easier, it is recommended to setup CMSSW, such that theta can use dependencies from CMSSW.
Setting up CMSSW, obtaining and compiling theta is then done with these commands:

::

 # 1. setup CMSSW
 scram p CMSSW CMSSW_5_3_19
 # setup environment variables
 cd CMSSW_5_3_19
 cmsenv

 # 2. checkout and compile theta:
 cd $HOME/your/favorite/location
 svn co https://ekptrac.physik.uni-karlsruhe.de/public/theta/tags/testing theta
 cd theta
 make

 # 3. setup PATH to find theta-auto.py (in theta/utils2)
 export PATH=$HOME/your/favorite/location/theta/utils2



Note that you should run the ``cmsenv`` and the ``export PATH`` line every time you login; all others only once to get started.

To obtain the scripts for the exercise, copy the content of  ``/afs/cern.ch/user/j/jott/public/hatslpc2014`` into one of your directories (I assume you use ``$HOME/hatslpc2014``):
::

 cp -a /afs/cern.ch/user/j/jott/public/hatslpc2014 $HOME


Test the Setup
==============

To test that your setup is working, go to the directory created in the last step above (``$HOME/hatslpc2014``) and execute the "exercise 0" script by calling ``theta-auto.py`` like this:

::

 cd $HOME/hatslpc2014
 theta-auto.py ex0.py


.. note:: The ``ex0.py`` script is used for testing only here; it contains a few hints that might be useful if you are new to python. Otherwise, you do not need to care about the contents of ``ex0.py``.

If everything is fine, this should produce an output similar to this one (``XXX`` is some user-dependent directory):

::

 Hello World!
 Hello World from indented code.
 called print_s with s=
 called print_s with s=hello world
 list items 0, 2: 1 3

You should also see that a file ``test.pdf`` has been created.

You can now get started with the exercises by reading tyhe instructions in these pages and editing the ``exX.py`` files. These files are executed via

::

 theta-auto.py exX.py
