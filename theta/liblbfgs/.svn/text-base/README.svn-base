modifications to lbfgs:
 * fix includes
 * the delta stopping criteria is tested against "fabs(f' - f)", NOT the original "(f' - f) / f". This is useful
   as f is a negative log-likelihood and we know the typical difference accuracy we want to acheive, but absolute
   values of the original stopping criterion does not have any meaning here.

TODO: use the sse optimizations
